# my-arduinos

This repository contains a collection of my small Arduino projects. The `.ino` sketches for Arduino IDE are located in their respective project directories, possibly along other resources.

## Projects

### Lightmeter

Light-Sensor BH1750 is used to measure the light conditions. Exposure Value is then shown on a TM1637 display.

### Dance Pad

A DIY dance pad to play StepMania (DDR) with.
